# Environmental Data Analytics & Schema Design

This repository documents the data modeling and analytical design for an environmental monitoring platform that ingests AQI and UV index data from external providers.

The goal is to define a clean storage schema and example analytical queries to support time-series analysis, aggregation, and reporting use cases.

This design complements a backend ingestion service and is intended to demonstrate data engineering fundamentals.
